                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Endeavour is a British television detective drama series on ITV. It is a prequel to the long-running Inspector Morse
                series. Shaun Evans portrays the young Endeavour Morse beginning his career as a detective constable, and later as a
                detective sergeant, with the Oxford City Police CID. Endeavour is the third of the Inspector Morse series following the
                original Inspector Morse (1987–2000) and its spin-off, Lewis (2006–2015).</p>

                        <h3>Series 1</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first full series begins with Morse transferring to the Oxford City Police in 1965 following a double-murder
                            investigation that took place during the pilot episode. Morse is taken under the wing of Inspector Thursday.
                            Thursday names Morse his designated "bagman" and shows him the ropes as Morse begins to solve a string of complex
                            multiple-murders, much to the envy and annoyance of some of his superiors, particularly Detective Sergeant Jakes and
                            Chief Superintendent Bright. Morse displays his genius in solving intricate murders, including several with opera
                            connections. Thursday and fellow-Constable Strange try to steer the young Morse into taking his sergeant's exam, so
                            that he may be relieved of "general duties" and become Thursday's official "bagman". In the last episode of the series,
                            Morse is shot while attempting to apprehend a murderer and is placed on light duties. At the same time, he comes to terms
                            with the death, in December 1965, of his cold, unfeeling father.

                        <h3>Series 2</h3>
                        <p>
                            Series 2 begins in 1966 with Morse returning to active duty at Cowley police station, after spending several
                            months on
                            light duty at Oxfordshire (County) Police's Witney station, under the direction of DI Bart Church. Morse is
                            received
                            warmly by Ch Supt Bright and DS Jakes, as DI Thursday begins to keep a more watchful eye on him. As a
                            delayed result of
                            being shot, Morse begins to suffer from stress and paranoia and increases his alcohol consumption. Despite
                            making
                            several mistakes in the investigation, Morse solves the case, impressing his superiors. During the
                            investigation he
                            suffers concussion after being struck over the head and is cared for by his nurse neighbour, Monica Hicks,
                            in whom he
                            takes an interest. At the same time, PC Strange enters into Freemasonry with many of Oxford's elite, and DI
                            Thursday's
                            daughter, Joan, begins to take an interest in Morse. During the course of several cases, pieces of
                            circumstantial
                            evidence go missing, and a murder suspect threatens Morse by claiming association with powerful men who will
                            not take
                            kindly to interference.
                
                            In the final episode, the looming merger of city and county police and misgivings about corruption lead
                            Thursday to
                            consider retirement, in response to strong hints from Ch Supt Bright about age and health. Disheartened by
                            this, Morse
                            speculates to Monica about leaving the police and going abroad with her. Assistant Chief Constable Clive
                            Deare asks
                            Thursday and Morse to investigate corruption within the police and council covertly. Morse is sent to a
                            rendezvous,
                            where he is ambushed by corrupt officers, and Thursday is lured to Blenheim Vale, a derelict former wayward
                            boys' home,
                            where there was rampant sexual and physical abuse (of which Jakes was a victim). Morse escapes the ambush
                            and goes to
                            support Thursday, who is shot by Deare, a participant in the abuse at Blenheim Vale. Deare tells Morse he
                            has framed him
                            for the murder of Chief Constable Rupert Standish. Deare is about to kill Morse when he is shot dead by a
                            girl who had
                            also been abused at Blenheim Vale and who then kills herself. Bright and Strange arrive with backup and an
                            ambulance. As
                            Thursday is being loaded into an ambulance, Morse is arrested by officers from another force for the murder
                            of Standish.
